# Heritage Cherry Trees in Washington, DC  
### Demo Map Created with the QGIS qgis2web Plugin

This repository contains a simple interactive web map generated using the **qgis2web** plugin in **QGIS**. The map displays Washington, DC’s **Heritage Street Trees** that are identified as cherry species (*Prunus*). Heritage trees are defined by the District Department of Transportation (DDOT) Urban Forestry Division as trees measuring **100 inches or more in circumference** at diameter at breast height (DBH).

The map was exported directly from QGIS as a **Leaflet** web map using qgis2web’s default settings. Symbol size reflects DBH using graduated marker sizes.

This repository is part of a **demonstration of a free and open-source workflow** for creating and publishing interactive maps without requiring ArcGIS Online or institutional licensing.  
The workflow used here:

1. **QGIS** – create and style the map  
2. **qgis2web (Leaflet export)** – generate a standalone HTML/JS web map  
3. **GitHub Pages** – host the interactive map online at no cost  

Anyone can adapt this workflow for their own community mapping or public-engagement projects.
